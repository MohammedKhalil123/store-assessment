There are missing things that were not done due to time constraints I would like to point out when I developed this project.

1- Theme class for tailwind is not used and configured. I would like to point out that this is a best practice to have tailwind theme to make development easier when there are multiple developers and theme to be consistent.
2- some filters are not used . like category (categories don't match) and price ( this can be done using query params but it is not required in the assessment )
3- Some components are not designed cause of lack of time and some of them are unnecessary due to API response and it is just dummy data.
4- Code can be refactored more for components as well but couldn't because of time constraints.



Please install dependencies first using npm install
then use npm run dev
