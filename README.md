During the development of this project, there were a few parts that couldn’t be completed due to time constraints.  
I’d like to highlight these areas for transparency:

---

###  1. Tailwind Theme Configuration

Theme class for tailwind is not used and configured. I would like to point out that this is a best practice to have tailwind theme to make development easier when there are multiple developers and theme to be consistent.

---

###  2. Filters

some filters are not used . like category (categories don't match) and price ( this can be done using query params but it is not required in the assessment )

---

###  3. Components & Dummy Data

Some components are not designed cause of lack of time and some of them are unnecessary due to API response and it is just dummy data.

---

###  4. Code Refactoring

Code can be refactored more for components as well but couldn't because of time constraints.
